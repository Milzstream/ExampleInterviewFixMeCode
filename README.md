# Code Interview Test
This Repo is storing an Azure Function project that has lots of coding functionality issues, syntax issues, process issues and other general bad coding concepts. The goal is to have the candidate step through the code and find mistakes and offer suggestions and improvements! The [List of Business Bugs that need addressing](#Business-Bugs-That-Need-Addressing) should be used as a list of complaints business users have made related to the underlying functionality! 

## Business Bugs That Need Addressing
* The Function name shows as Function1 instead of UpdateReward!
* Whenever I add a Description the Reward Description doesn't seemed to be updated!
* I Wish I knew what model validation issues occured so that I know what specifically needs to be fixed in my request!
* For some reason I can't call the function as a POST, only as a GET?
